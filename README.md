## Hello, I’m Jianping Zhou! 👋

🚀 **About Me**
I’m a Ph.D. candidate at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. My research interests include time series, spatio-temporal data mining, knowledge graph and AI for Science.

🔭 I’m currently working on **missing problems** in spatio-temporal data and multivariate time series. What's more, I'm trying to use LLMs to solve time series and spatio-temporal data mining problems and contribute to the development of **multimodal foundation models**.

🌱 I am currently collaborating with **Environmental Science** researchers to explore the molecular annotation of **Emerging Contaminants**.

👯 I am looking for collaborations and am also open to interested undergraduate interns. Please feel free to contact me!
