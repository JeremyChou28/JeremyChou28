## Hello, Iâ€™m Jianping Zhou! ðŸ‘‹

ðŸš€ **About Me**
Iâ€™m a Ph.D. candidate at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. My research interests include time series, spatio-temporal data mining, knowledge graph and AI for Science.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on **missing problems** in spatio-temporal data and multivariate time series. What's more, I'm trying to use LLMs to solve time series and spatio-temporal data mining problems and contribute to the development of **multimodal foundation models**.

ðŸŒ± I am currently collaborating with researchers in **Geoscience** to explore the application of AI in cross-disciplinary research.

ðŸ‘¯ I am looking for collaborations and am also open to interested undergraduate interns. Please feel free to contact me!
